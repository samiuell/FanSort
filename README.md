# FanSort

## Purpose
In only 29 questions, FanSort finds your Hogwarts house and your Myers-Brigg Type Indicator. With 
extensive research through datasets with hundreds of Pottermore house test results, and reports done on 
the meaning behind the letters in an MBTI code, FanSort has come up with an original collection of question sets connecting the two quizes together. 
Randomizing the questions to give you and your friends the best experience, FanSort strives to provide you 
a space to explore yourself and learn about the results you recieve. 

## Motivation
Anyone who has been a fan of a popular book series or movie franchise has been through the experience of 
going through random personality quizes online to futher immerse themself into the universe. Countless hours
are wasted completing multiple lengthy and oftentimes tedious tests. We at FanSort aim to make the lives of 
fans everywhere just a little bit easier. While starting with two of the most popular personality tests, we
promise to bring in even more quizes and results in the future.
